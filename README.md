# Tuco-Tuco

#### Tuco-Tuco is an app about wildlife conservation. It's inspired by an animal called tuco-tuco, which lives in the beaches of southern Brazil and was very present in my childhood. 

#### I used to spot him digging the sand dunes near the house I spent my summer holidays at. Now, his appearances are rarer due to human presence and habitat loss. 

#### So making this app granted me the opportunity to see the tuco-tuco once more and I hope it can raise awareness of all endangered species!
